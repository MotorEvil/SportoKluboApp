<h1> Workout and users managing WebApp <h1>
  
  <h5> May name is Žydrūnas, I'm entry/junior level developer, this is my first real world app. When I say real world app, I have in mind that I want to publish it in future to be used by local pole dance gym (I'm not the athlete :D my girlfriend is). I came up with this idea to make it as probono project, to help trainers to manage workouts and users, sinc right now they use old paper stile managing system :)<h5>
